# Vizualizing Indian Development and Natural Resource Data
Comp 150 Visualization final class project with William Butt, Nate Tenczar, Sean Hirata, and Alden Keefe Sampson. Built for Professor Nimah Mazaheri, a political scientist at Tufts University, this visualization looks at the relationships and geographic patterns between different sets of population data and coal production at the district level in India. Data is taken from the 2001 Indian Census (www.censusindia.gov.in/) and indiastat.com.   

This visualization is primarily implemented in Processing (java) and depends on the ControlP5 library and Jon Reades' MapThing library.

Included is a Mac OSX version of the application.
