Loading Data:

The data paths are hardcoded. 
The CSVs need to be in a data directory in the sketchfolder: 
-buttczar/data/states.csv
-buttczar/data/districts.csv

The shapefiles all need to be a shapes directory inside the data directory:
-buttczar/data/shapes

How to Use Program:

You can use the drop-down menus at the top to choose which variables to look at. They will show up on the x-axis, y-axis, or in how big the circles are. You can also filter by state with a drop-down. There is a coal button that toggles between all districts and only districts that produce coal.

Hovering over a circle generates a tooltip, which displays the district and state name, and values of the chosen variables.

If you click and drag over circles, the districts corresponding to those circles will turn black on the map. Clicking on the graph again de-selects every district. 

If any of this is unclear, you can click on the HELP button for instructions.

Thing That Doesn't Work Well:

If you select hundreds of districts, it has to render millions of points and it will be slow. :(
