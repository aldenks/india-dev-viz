How to Run:
This runs in Processing. Unfortunately, our project is dependent upon 2 libraries and the java export functions in Processing are not working with it. In order to compile and run, you need to install a GUI library called controlP5 and a map rendering library called MapThing, both of which we have provided. To install it, just put the controlP5 and MapThing directories into the Processing/libraries directory.
 
The “Main” file is called buttczar.
